		You are a few  clicks away from being able to access the best talent Strathmore University has  to offer. Welcome to the Career Dev. Office website, Employer section. The Career Dev.  Office prepares the students for the world of work and has provided a facility  where students and alumni can upload their CVs online as well as apply for jobs  directly.
		<br>
		The employer  facility on the other hand enables you as an employer to reach out to the vast  talent available through the website. An employer, once registered with the  Career Dev. Office, will be able to search and download suitable Cvs for  positions they wish to fill, upload job adverts for interested candidates to  apply directly as well as sensitize students on their graduate recruitment  programs.
		<br>
		To get started  you must first create an account and log in.
